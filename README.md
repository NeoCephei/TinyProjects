# TinyProjects
Small collection of projects I did in order to learn WebDev

## Description 
In this repo you will find a few projects I did while learning how to become a WebDev.
On each project I was practising something different, from DOM manipulation to API calls.
The last project I did needs API Key from [TMBD](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## How does it works?
Actually there are 6 projects listed.

* Stopwatch
* Calculator
* Lorem Ipsum
* TicTacToe
* Pokedex
* Movies

Here you can find a brief description of every project

| Name      | Objective | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Stopwatch      | **Learn Time Manipulation** | Simple Stopwatch that allows to start, pause, stop and reset.  |
|
| Calculator      | **Avoid eval when dealing with operations** | Calculator to perfom basic operations avoiding usage of .eval() to do the operations. |
|
| Lorem Ipsum      | **Type fake, tracker** | Generates Lorem Ipsum text as the user smash the keyboard.  |
|
| TicTacToe      | **Create my own drag & drop using plain Js** | Tic Tac Toe game with extra difficulty, as players can take opponent's position if the piece is bigger, extra difficulty, extra fun  |
|
| Pokedex     | **First API calls + Modals** | Generates a small pokedex with modal pop up on click + navigation and search bar for specific pokemon  |
|
| Movies      | **Personal Usage** | App to show common movies between providers and countries, to be able to watch same movies with far away beloveds  |


## Future Plans
I dont have any future plan for this repo, but for sure I will work again on different repos to improve the pokedex and movies projects.
I will try to create a better website for both projects and deploy them for global usage.
